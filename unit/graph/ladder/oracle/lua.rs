//! Lua rungs (plan v2.30 step 4; design booklet §8 row Lua). A Lua
//! module is whatever `package.searchers` finds (Lua 5.4 manual §6.3):
//! `require` first answers a name `package.loaded` already holds — the
//! standard libraries, LuaJIT's built-ins — and otherwise asks each
//! template of `package.path` in turn, `?` standing for the name with
//! its dots turned into slashes. The sites (graph/sites/call.rs) walk:
//!   R1 `require "a.b"`: `a/b` in every search directory — the tree
//!      root, `src` and `lua` (the luarocks and Neovim layouts), the
//!      declared `[graph.search_roots] lua` and the requiring file's
//!      own directory, each tried as `a/b.lua` then `a/b/init.lua` (the
//!      standard order), and every template the tree's own files
//!      assign to `package.path` as it is written (lua_path.rs,
//!      Scope::lua). The own directory is the standard path's
//!      `./?.lua` read the way R2 reads a path — a run from the file's
//!      own directory or from the root (paths.rs beside_or_root) — and
//!      it is what a loader that prepends the directory of the code it
//!      loads makes of `require`: a plugin loader's
//!      `string.format("%s/?.lua;%s", plugin_root, package.path)`, a
//!      test runner's `lpath` per spec directory. Two directories
//!      answering two different files is ambiguous_root: which one a
//!      run tries first is the order its path was built in, no fact of
//!      the text;
//!   R2 `dofile` / `loadfile` (label `load`): the path beside the
//!      loading file, then under the tree root — a path is relative to
//!      the working directory, the script's own or the project root by
//!      convention; the first hit;
//!   R3 External: a standard library or built-in name (the package's
//!      `ladder.lua.stdlib`, CE.Lang.Common.Ladder2) — it
//!      never reaches the searchers, whatever files the tree holds.
//! Anything else is out_of_scope: a module a rock or a C library
//! provides, any other directory a run adds by computing it
//! (`string.format("%s/?.lua", dir)`) — misses, never a guessed edge.
