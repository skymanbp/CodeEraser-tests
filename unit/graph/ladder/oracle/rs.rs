//! Rust rungs (design §4 row 3). R1 `mod foo;` builds the module
//! structure: dir/foo.rs | dir/foo/mod.rs, where dir is the declarer's
//! child directory (its own dir for crate roots — Cargo surface — and
//! mod.rs, dir/<stem>/ otherwise). R2 `use crate::…` walks that tree
//! from the covering crate root(s), stopping at the DEEPEST in-scope
//! child module: remaining segments are items or inline modules
//! INSIDE that file — or names on its re-export surface, which the
//! binder answers (R5 below). R3 self::/super:: — the same tree
//! anchored at the site's own file, with inline `mod` depth consumed
//! BEFORE any file climb (the audited interpolate.rs/globset rows: a
//! use inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` means super IS the enclosing
//! file); a self:: path in an inline module or matching no child
//! resolves to the file ITSELF (the island red condition: intra-file
//! references come home, never dangle); a bare head declared as a
//! module in the site's own namespace is the same local tree (uniform
//! paths — §4 amendment, plan v2.17 L round step 8, ruling ④), read
//! before any crate name. R4 bare head: builtin crates and declared
//! dependencies (registry or out-of-scope path) ⇒ External; an
//! in-scope package matching by normalized name ('-' → '_') anchors at
//! its lib root and the remaining segments descend its tree — the
//! audit records the definition file, not the crate façade. A crate::
//! walk that stops at BOTH roots of a lib+bin package (the same
//! amendment) is settled by the root whose top level holds the next
//! segment; neither or both still refuse.
//!
//! R5: `#[path = "…"]` remaps answer at R1 (pre-registered, the
//! literal answers at R1): the attribute is read off the per-sweep
//! cached tree; the base is the declaring file's own directory, and
//! inside inline modules child_dir plus the enclosing mod names
//! (rustc reference, both habitats). Macro-generated mod/use never
//! parse as mod_item/use_declaration, so the macro bucket is
//! structurally empty (the Python dynamic precedent). Specs are
//! first-line fragments (sites.rs), but rustfmt folds `use` only at
//! brace groups, so the pre-`{` prefix — all the walk consumes — is
//! complete whenever a brace is present; a fragment ending in `::`
//! with NO brace is a hand-folded cut, read back whole off the tree
//! at the site's line (rs_use::whole_spec, plan v2.30 step 5b) and
//! never guessed shallow. Symbol binding landed 2026-08-18 (§4 R5
//! amendment, user-ratified): a single unambiguous top-level `pub
//! use` binds ONE hop to the definition file — rs_reexport.rs owns
//! the surface facts, rs_bind::bound owns the hop; since step 5b a
//! glob is followed when the module it names exports the name and a
//! `pub extern crate` binds its crate, while ambiguity and a local
//! definition keep the file-level edge. The audited BinaryDetection
//! row's façade answer is thereby repaid at the definition point.
