//! C / C++ rungs (plan v2.30 step 2; the compile database completed
//! in step 5b, item 14; the `include` rung in step 6; design booklet
//! §8 row C / C++). The site is a
//! `preproc_include`, and its spec keeps the delimiter form the
//! detector left it — `x.h` for `"x.h"` (quotes trimmed like every
//! string specifier), `<x.h>` for the system form — because the form
//! IS the search order the language defines (C17 §6.10.2):
//!   R1 the including file's own directory, for the quoted form only —
//!      unless every compile of the file passes `-I-`, which "inhibits
//!      the use of the directory of the current file directory as the
//!      first search directory" (GCC);
//!   R2 the declared roots, `[graph.search_roots] c` (C++ shares the
//!      key), each directory joined with the spec — two directories
//!      holding two different files is ambiguous_root: the declaration
//!      is the authority here, and it named no order;
//!   R3 the compile database (c_index.rs): the chains the file
//!      compiles under — its own entries in the databases clangd would
//!      find (compdb_find.rs), else the chains of the translation units
//!      whose include closure reaches it, else the `compile_flags.txt`
//!      whose directory is the nearest holding any database — each
//!      searched in the preprocessor's class order (c_search.rs: the
//!      quoted form asks the `-iquote` class first, both forms the `-I`
//!      then the system class; cl's quoted form asks the include
//!      stack's directories before `/I`), first hit per chain; two
//!      chains answering two files is ambiguous_root — a name the build
//!      compiles as two files;
//!   R4 the `include` directory beside the including file's own
//!      directory or beside any ancestor of it, the tree root among
//!      them — the layout a build compiles with `-I include` so that an
//!      in-tree `#include <lib/x.h>` spells the way the installed header
//!      under `$(includedir)` does (fmt's CMake declares that one
//!      directory for its library and every test target: the step 6
//!      audit's truths, docs/EVAL-SET-LANGS.md); both forms, and only
//!      for a file no compile chain reaches — a tree that carries its
//!      build configuration has said what its include directories are,
//!      and a name that build does not find is not found; a directory a
//!      build script alone declares (a makefile's `-I`, a
//!      `target_include_directories`) reaches the ladder as a compile
//!      database (R3) or a declared root (R2), never by reading the
//!      script; two `include` directories on the ancestry holding two
//!      files is ambiguous_root — which `-I` came first is the build's,
//!      no fact of the tree;
//!   R5 External: the system form with no hit is a toolchain or system
//!      header. The quoted form with no hit is out_of_scope.
//! NEVER a basename search of the tree: two `util.h` in one repository
//! are two files, and picking one would invent an edge (the register's
//! "no basename search" row); R4 joins one fixed directory name onto
//! the includer's own ancestry and searches for nothing.
