//! The path-joining steps the Rust ladders still share (plan v2.30
//! step 4): R's declared roots and Haskell's search directories judge a
//! set of candidates the same way, and R's `source` reads a path the
//! way a script's working directory does. C's and Lua's copies of these
//! steps moved into the core with their ladders (`CE.Resolve`, plan
//! v2.33 W2a).
