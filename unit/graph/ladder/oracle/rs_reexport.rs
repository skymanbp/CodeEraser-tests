//! The Rust re-export surface (§4 R5 as amended 2026-08-18: `pub
//! use` binds ≤1 hop to the DEFINITION file). This module answers the
//! surface QUESTIONS about one file — which names its top-level pub
//! uses bind, and to which full paths; the hop itself runs in
//! rs_bind.rs through the bind-free walk, so the ≤1 bound is
//! structural, and the tree reading is the child rs_surface.rs. Since
//! plan v2.30 step 5b the surface also carries what the amendment
//! first refused: a `pub use p::*` glob is followed when the module it
//! names exports the name (`exports` — one hop, a glob inside that
//! module is not followed), and a `pub extern crate x [as y]` binds
//! `x` / `y` to the crate as a global path (`::x`). Refusals stay the
//! honest half: a name F defines ITSELF at top level never hops
//! (definition wins), >1 matching entry — or >1 glob carrying the
//! name — keeps the file-level edge (picking would invent a path).
//! Since step 8 the same file also answers the crate rung's tie-break
//! (`owns`), so the hashed projection covers every top-level fact a
//! walk consults: the pub-use surface with its globs, the private use
//! bindings, and the item names with their visibility.
