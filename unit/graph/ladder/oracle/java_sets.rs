//! Java source sets (plan v2.30 step 5): the Maven and Gradle standard
//! layout keeps a module's code in `<module>/src/<set>/java/`, and the
//! build compiles each set against what it may see — `main` against
//! main code alone (no test output is ever on its classpath), any other
//! set (`test`, `integrationTest`, a `testFixtures`) against itself and
//! main code. A package split between `main` and `test` is therefore
//! half a package to a main file and a whole one to a test file, and a
//! package answer names one directory: the part in the importing file's
//! own source root when that root holds one — the nearest part, as a
//! simple name's own directory comes first (java.rs R3). What else a
//! non-main set sees (another module's test fixtures) is build
//! configuration this ladder does not read, so only the certain rule
//! filters: a main file sees no other set. A file outside the layout
//! sees every file, as before.
