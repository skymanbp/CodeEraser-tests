//! Markdown rungs (design §4 row 5). Doc targets resolve at FILE and
//! SECTION granularity. R1 joins a relative target against the
//! linking file's directory — a judged file, or a walked asset the
//! index never parsed (an image, a stylesheet; plan v2.30 step 5b,
//! the HTML rungs' second candidate set); a directory holding
//! in-scope files resolves as a package — the audited fourclass row:
//! a tree reference collapsed to one file would be a guess. R2
//! validates a
//! cross-file anchor, percent-decoded, against the target's anchor
//! set (md_slug.rs: rendered-text slugs of the ATX headings by GitHub
//! rules — lowercase, punctuation dropped, spaces to hyphens, -N
//! duplicate suffixes — plus raw-HTML anchor ids verbatim); zero or
//! multiple matches degrade to the file (ResolvedSection { slug:
//! None }). R3 reference links substitute
//! the in-file definition (CommonMark: labels case-fold and the
//! FIRST definition wins — spec, not a guess) and rerun the chain
//! relabeled rung 3; an unused definition is deliberately EXCLUDED
//! from liveness — a definition that renders nothing must not keep
//! its target alive (user decision D3). Since 2.29.0 (H1 slice 16,
//! the executed post-1.0 disposition) the exclusion is the CORE's:
//! an in-scope unused definition resolves and travels as an INERT
//! edge (EDGE_REFDEF_UNUSED) that liveness drops beside the asset
//! kind, and an unresolvable one is an ordinary miss — the borrowed
//! External category retired with the channel that replaced it
//! (Outcome::ResolvedInert). R4 a bare fragment is an
//! in-file section claim taken AS WRITTEN, never validated: a claim
//! on the linking document itself is an in-file edge whatever it
//! names (the audited FAQ.md #complete row's raw-HTML anchor is one
//! such — modeled for cross-file lookups since step 8, still not a
//! reason to refuse an in-file claim). R5 any URI scheme (http/https/
//! mailto per the design row) is External; site-root (/x) and
//! protocol-relative (//x) forms are domain-relative in rendered
//! contexts, never repo-relative.
//!
//! The anchor set is the rendered heading's slug (ATX and setext —
//! md_head.rs, plan v2.17 L round step 8 and v2.30 step 5b), the
//! heading walk is block-aware, raw-HTML anchors enter the set from a
//! tag read across lines and attribute spellings, and percent escapes
//! decode (md_slug.rs); a fragment that matches no anchor degrades to
//! file level, never invents a section. Cross-file staleness is
//! closed at the key (M5 close, repaying the 2f wiring debt): the
//! ONLY target-content fact this ladder consults is the anchor set
//! (anchor() below), so every md file's slug_hash is a resolve_key
//! input — a heading edit anywhere shifts the key and the phase-2
//! sweep re-validates every anchor.
