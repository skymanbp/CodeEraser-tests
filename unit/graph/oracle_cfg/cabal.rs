//! Cabal-file surface for the Haskell ladder (design §4 pattern:
//! gomod.rs / roots.rs — one minimal parser per resolver config,
//! bytes in resolve_key so answers cannot go stale). Only the facts
//! the rungs and the mounts table consume are modeled: per-stanza
//! `hs-source-dirs` (the R1 root set), the union of `build-depends`
//! package names (the external gate), the package `name` and which
//! stanza is the public library (plan v2.30 step 5b: the R2
//! cross-package rung reads a depended package's exposed modules
//! under its library roots), and since plan v2.17 piece
//! (5) the two package-privacy facts the sealed criterion §4 reads —
//! whether a `library` stanza exists at all, and which modules are
//! listed only under other-modules. A `common` stanza's roots and
//! module lists reach a component through its `import:` (plan v2.17
//! L round step 8, O58 — before it the common block was a dead
//! region and a package whose roots lived only there anchored every
//! stanza at the package directory). Stated boundaries, degrading to
//! refusals never guesses: cabal.project is not consulted (owner
//! anchoring is directory-prefix), and conditional blocks (`if
//! os(..)`) contribute their fields unconditionally — tag evaluation
//! needs a build configuration we do not have (the Go //go:build
//! precedent). The layout walk itself is the `#[path]` child
//! cabal_parse.rs; this file owns the types and the reads.
