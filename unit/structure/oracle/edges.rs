//! File-edge participation (the S3 misplacement input): file-level
//! reference edges roll up, through the tree::dir_of join, to per-file
//! (inside, outside) counts. Pure functions over plain indices — the
//! S2 runner adapts the cached graph wire into `file_dirs`, and NOTHING
//! here judges: whether a file's majority neighborhood living elsewhere
//! is misplacement is the core's call (the ADR-008 boundary), this
//! module only counts. The directed (dirA, dirB) table left with the
//! v2.18 subtraction batch because nothing judged it; it comes back at
//! 7.1.0 (O54) with the modularity axis that does. The INTRA counts do
//! not come back with it: an intra edge adds 1 to `inside` at both of
//! its ends, so `aggregate`'s output already carries twice the intra
//! mass, and the core halves it rather than read a second copy off the
//! wire.
