//! The five arch/1 request tables off one graph wire and one tree
//! (design booklet docs/reference/analysis-track.md §7.1; the step-9
//! measuring-side rulings 1–6). The node universe is the structure
//! family's: the measured FILE nodes of the deadcode wire, in path
//! order, dense from 0. The directories are that family's tree over
//! those paths. The references are the graph's file → file arcs (any
//! kind, any rung, through the structure family's own join), a section
//! target folded onto its file, and the file → package arcs onto the
//! package's directory. Counting and numbering only — the directory
//! graph, its cuts, layers, clusters and the impact walk are the
//! core's (CE.Arch.*).
